# Linked lists in Ruby
An implementation of the linked list data structure created using Ruby. Linked lists aren't required in Ruby as an array handles all of the operations that a linked list would be used for, so this was created to gain a better understanding of the data structure.

Created as part of the Odin Project's [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists)
